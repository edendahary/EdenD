This is an object oriented programmin project which his main idea is based on functions.
This Project Made by Eden Dahary Student in Ariel University.
This project contains an stdDraw interface .
On this project you will find kinds of objects such as : Monom, Polynom, and Complex Function .
Monom - Monom represents a simple "Monom" of shape a*x^b, where a is a real number and b is an integer (summed a none negative).
Polynom - Polynom represents a Polynom at the form of: " 3x^2+x^4+6 " for example.
Complex Function- represents a ComplexFunction which countains :Operator(Polynom,Polynom).
